##These functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function outputs a special "matrix" that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix function 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
